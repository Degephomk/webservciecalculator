##Webservice Calculator

Webservice Calculator is a simple web application that allows users to perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project was inspired by my desire to create a simple and user-friendly calculator that anyone can use without any prior knowledge of programming or complex mathematics. The goal was to create a web-based calculator that can be accessed from any device with an internet connection.

##Technology & Architecture
The calculator is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses the DOM to display the user interface and to process user input. The calculator logic is implemented in JavaScript, and it uses the eval() function to evaluate the user's mathematical expression. The application is deployed on Heroku, which provides a free hosting service for small-scale applications.

Core Algorithms and Code Snippet
The following code snippet shows how the calculator logic is implemented:
function calculate() {
  var result = eval(document.getElementById("expression").value);
  document.getElementById("result").value = result;
}
This function retrieves the user's input from the "expression" field, evaluates it using the eval() function, and displays the result in the "result" field.

Discussion of Process, Collaboration, and Timeline
This project was developed individually, and the timeline for development was approximately two weeks. The development process involved several stages, including planning, designing the user interface, implementing the calculator logic, and testing the application. The project was managed using GitHub, which allowed for version control and collaboration.

Challenge(s) Overcome
The most difficult technical challenge I encountered during development was implementing the calculator logic. I initially tried to write the code to evaluate the user's expression manually, but I quickly realized that this was a complex and error-prone process. I eventually settled on using the eval() function, which simplified the code and reduced the likelihood of errors.

The most difficult non-technical challenge was designing the user interface. I wanted the calculator to be simple and intuitive, but I also wanted it to look professional and visually appealing. I spent several hours experimenting with different color schemes and layouts before settling on the final design.

Learnings About Technical Interests as a Result of this Project
This project gave me a deeper appreciation for the power and flexibility of JavaScript. I was able to implement a wide range of mathematical operations using only a few lines of code, thanks to the built-in functions and operators provided by the language. Additionally, I learned how to use Heroku to deploy a web application, which is a valuable skill for any web developer.

Installation
To run this application locally, simply clone the repository and open index.html in your browser.

Usage
To use the calculator, enter a mathematical expression in the input field and click the "Calculate" button. The result will be displayed in the output field.
